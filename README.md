[Alternative Label Select] is a module for [Omeka S] that improves the form
element Property Select in order to list all alternate labels. It contains some
optimizations too.

This module was previously integrated in module [Advanced Resource Template]
until version 3.4.28.

The next version will manage resource classes too.
